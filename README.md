# Wipro_Week_1_Assessment

Technologies used: HTML/HTML3, CSS/CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery.

The goal of this assignment is to build a small, simple web application. The main functions of the application are as follows:
1. Retrieve the information from the user's input fields, using a form (types of input fields: text, email, radio buttons, and date).
2. Validate all user's inputs accordingly.
3. After successful validation, store the user's data in the local browser storage.
4. Populate user's input fields with the data retrieved from the local storage.

Extra add-ons applied for training purposes:
1. Responsive web design using media queries.
2. Navigation bar.
3. Toggle menu button for small screen devices.
4. Applied grid layout using a grid.css file (columns' widths).

Future improvements based on the feedback:
1. Fix the toggle menu button (revealed menu moves the content of the below parts).
2. Optimise the code for Java Script function (ternary operator instead of multi-lined 'if statement'). FIXED.
3. Optimise the code reducing comments (too many unnecessary lines). FIXED.
4. Find the explanation for a jQuery selector.
5. Enhance validation for an email input field (add a matcher). FIXED.
