# Wipro_Week_1_Assessment

#### Technologies used: HTML/HTML3, CSS/CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery.

#### The goal of this assignment is to build a small, simple web application. The main functions of the application are:
1. Retrieve the information from the user's input fields, using a form (types of input fields: text, email, radio buttons, and date).
2. Validate all user's inputs accordingly.
3. After successful validation, store the user's data in the local browser storage.
4. Populate user's input fields with the data retrieved from the local storage.

#### Extra add-ons applied for training purposes:
1. Responsive web design using media queries.
2. Navigation bar.
3. Toggle menu button for small screen devices.
4. Applied grid layout using a grid.css file (columns' widths).

#### Future improvements based on the feedback:
###### A) First review/feedback:
1. Fix the toggle menu button (revealed menu moves the content of the below parts).
2. Optimise the code for Java Script function (ternary operator instead of multi-lined *if statement*). UPDATED.
3. Optimise the code reducing comments (too many unnecessary lines). UPDATED.
4. Find the explanation for a jQuery selector. DONE.
5. Enhance validation for an email input field (add a matcher). UPDATED.
6. Update the readme.md file with descriptions. UPDATED.
###### B) Second review/feedback (5th April):
1. Ternary operator broken into smaller parts in order not to repeat the parts of the code (first review part 2). UPDATED.
2. Replace the *each* jQuery function with a Java Script expression to avoid unnecessary looping. UPDATED.
3. Replace the *input type submit* with the *button* in HTML form (make it clear it's not an input from the user). UPDATED.
4. Add an extra function to add user details to local database - to use more meaningful function name *(addUserDataToLocalDatabase(key, value))*.
5. Advantages of Kotlin over Java specifically in Android. PREPARED.
6. The *use strict* in Java Script. PREPARED.
7. What does JQuery selector do when selecting multiple elements that have the same class. PREPARED.
